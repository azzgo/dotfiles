# Decision log

Keep one canonical log.

Adapted from pstack's `show-me-your-work` (renamed to avoid clashing with the
`show-me` visual-explanation skill). Other skills route their audit trail here
instead of inventing one. Reference it by name and let it own the format.

## The format

A single TSV file, one row per decision. Cells stay single-line. Evidence is a
pointer, not prose.

Copy `references/decision-log-template.tsv` (the header row) to start a clean
log. Columns:

- **ts.** ISO8601 timestamp.
- **phase.** The phase or workstream.
- **decision.** What was chosen or done, one line.
- **why.** The reason in plain words. If a principle drove it, say it plainly, not as a jargon tag.
- **evidence.** A link or path that proves it: commit SHA, PR number, `file:line`, or an artifact, trace, or screenshot path. Never a paragraph.
- **result.** The outcome or predicate state: `tests green`, `reverted`, `pixel-diff 0`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, `open`.

An example, plain-spoken so a reviewer reads it at a glance. This is
illustration only. Don't copy these rows into a real log.

```
ts	phase	decision	why	evidence	result
2026-05-24T09:02:00Z	frame	counted the work first, about 100 components and roughly 75 hours	wanted to know the size before starting a long run	commit 3a9f1c2	found 5 things to sort out before starting
2026-05-24T09:40:00Z	harness	took screenshots of the old version before changing anything	so we can compare old against new and catch any visual change	scripts/snapshot.sh, baseline/	saved 120 reference screenshots
2026-05-24T11:15:00Z	widget	moved the widget styles over without changing how it looks	keep the change small and the result identical	commit 7c21e0a, pixel-diff 0	looks identical, tests pass
2026-05-24T12:30:00Z	widget	threw out a helper's work because its screenshots were blank	checked the real files instead of trusting its summary	worktree reset	reverted, tightened the instructions for next time
```

## Logging a row

Write each entry the way you'd tell a teammate what you did. Plain words,
concrete actions, no AI speak or abstract jargon.

Use the helper `scripts/log.sh <logfile> <phase> <decision> <why> <evidence>
<result>`. It stamps `ts`, writes the header on first use, strips stray
tabs/newlines, and prefixes any cell starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` with a
single quote. A bare `printf` appending a row works too, but mind those same
bytes if cells come from generated or user-supplied text.

Log decision points and checkpoints, not every action: a fork chosen, a unit
completed with its verification result, a pivot or revert with its trigger, a
blocker surfaced, a gate fixed. For loop runs, one row per iteration. Skip the
trivial and self-evident.

## Where it lives

By default the log is a working artifact, not committed. Keep it at
`decisions.tsv` in the work dir, or `.audit/<task-slug>.tsv` when several
efforts run at once, and leave it out of git.

Commit it only when the work is ambitious enough that a reviewer needs the
trail to trust the result.

## Rules

- One row is one decision or checkpoint.
- Append-only. A wrong call gets a new row that supersedes it. Never edit or delete history.
- Prefer evidence produced by committed scripts over hand-made one-offs.

## Audit the log against what actually happened

At the end of the run, before handing back, check the log told the truth. Use
the best available record of the run: the running agent's session transcript
(whatever path or session store the host exposes — e.g. agentsview for recorded
sessions), or the artifacts the run produced. Don't read other projects' or
other agents' transcripts. Walk the log against what actually happened:

- Every row maps to a real action. Cut invented or aspirational entries.
- Each row's evidence resolves and shows what the row claims.
- A fork, pivot, or abandoned approach that shaped the work but isn't logged is a gap. Add it.
- Drop padding.

Fix the log, not the story. If the work diverged from what a row claims, the
row is wrong.

## Cross-model review of the trail (when available)

If the environment can spawn a subagent on a model family different from the
one that did the work, do it before handing back. Self-review is not a
substitute. The subagent reads the audit trail and the run's record, then
flags what the user should pay attention to. Not a redo of the work, a scan
for what's suboptimal or risky:

- Decisions logged with weak or absent evidence.
- Verification steps skipped or claimed without proof.
- Choices that look risky in hindsight (premature, scope-creeping, papering over a symptom).
- Gaps the user would otherwise miss on a casual skim.

Every reply for a run that produced a trail ends with an "Attention" section.
Lead with the reviewer's model on its own line (`reviewed by <model>`), then
list each flag pointing to specific rows or moments. "No flags" is a valid
value. The model name is not. If no second model family is available, say so
and skip this step rather than self-reviewing in its name.

## Reviewing the trail

Read top to bottom, follow the evidence pointers, spot-check. GitHub renders a
committed TSV as a table. `column -s$'\t' -t decisions.tsv` renders it in a
terminal.
