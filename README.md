# DotFiles for Archives


The dotfiles are common used in my work and life.

In nowadays, just use neovim and vim

## Neovim

Neovim must 5.1+ï¼Œfor use some lua plugin which is only supported after 5.1.


When i prepare the config, learned a lot from this repo [dotfiles-public](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public/blob/master/.config/nvim/after/plugin/telescope.rc.vim)

when to started, need run 

```viml
:COQdeps
```

to update Coq depends, otherwise the completion won't work


## Vim 

The vim config is only a minimal config for liking server enviroment editor, so it doesn't have magic here.
