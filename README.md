# DotFiles for Archives


The dotfiles are common used in my work and life.

In nowadays, just use neovim and vim

## Neovim

Neovim must 7.0+ï¼Œfor use some lua plugin which is only supported after 7.0

When i prepare the config, learned a lot from this repo [dotfiles-public](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public/blob/master/.config/nvim/after/plugin/telescope.rc.vim)

need prepare at least g++, gcc for treesitter syntax file compile. and make for telescope fzf binding.


## Vim 

The vim config is only a minimal config for liking server enviroment editor, so it doesn't have magic here.
